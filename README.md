# MNIST Sandbox

## TODOs

I started this project in high school and there are many improvements I plan to make:

- [ ] A proper README
- [ ] A proper installation process such that anyone can run the repo locally (w/ automatic training data download - change to [EMNIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset))?
- [ ] The predictions for drawn digits are still finnicky and not as accurate as the training dataset; investigate this
- [ ] GUI responsivity - scroll bars, pop-ups for errors, loading bars
- [ ] Better seperation of concerns between GUI and logic
- [ ] Revisit directory structure
